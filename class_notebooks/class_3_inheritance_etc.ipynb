    "A class encapsulates a concept in its entirety. Classes own and control all the member variables within them. If you want access to those variables, or want to change those variables, you should do so through class functions.\n",
    "This concept allows you to govern the state of a class at any given time, so that things do not change out from underneath you unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be thought of as a response to the 'open sandbox' paradigm of earlier languages-- C++, SAS, etc introduced a generation of programmers to the dilemna of how to ensure a global variable (ie: one that can change out from under a piece of code depending on the last thing that interacted with it) can be both accessible (it can be modified) AND protected (nothing that you weren't expecting will overwrite it)\n"

They all have some implementation of .speak() and all work in the same function in any mix of the above!"
